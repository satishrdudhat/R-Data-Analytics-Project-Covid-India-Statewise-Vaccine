# R-Data-Analytics-Project-Covid-India-Statewise-Vaccine
I developed a comprehensive interactive dashboard in R-Studio using R and an Excel dataset to analyze state-wise COVID-19 vaccination trends. The project involved data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization, featuring dose comparisons, booster coverage, age-wise trends, and key insights using ggplot2, Plotly, and Flexdashboard.

## Interactive Dashboard creation using R language

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze COVID-19 vaccination data across Indian states and Union Territories. The analysis aims to provide insights into vaccination coverage, dose distribution, and booster dose uptake. By visualizing trends and patterns, the dashboard helps stakeholders understand progress, identify gaps, and optimize vaccination strategies.
