# R-Data-Analytics-Project-Covid-India-Statewise-Vaccine

I developed a comprehensive interactive dashboard in R-Studio using R and an Excel dataset to analyze state-wise COVID-19 vaccination trends. The project involved data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization, featuring dose comparisons, booster coverage, age-wise trends, and key insights using ggplot2, Plotly, and Flexdashboard.

# Covid India Statewise Vaccine Data Analysis Dashboard 
## Interactive Dashboard creation using R language

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze COVID-19 vaccination data across Indian states and Union Territories. The analysis aims to provide insights into vaccination coverage, dose distribution, and booster dose uptake. By visualizing trends and patterns, the dashboard helps stakeholders understand progress, identify gaps, and optimize vaccination strategies.

## Key Questions (KPIs)

1.	Total Vaccination Trends
    •	How many total doses have been administered across India?
    •	Which states have the highest and lowest vaccination rates?
2.	Dose-1 vs Dose-2 Coverage
    •	How does Dose-1 coverage compare to Dose-2 across states?
    •	What percentage of the population is fully vaccinated?
3.	Booster Dose Administration
    •	What is the distribution of precautionary (booster) doses across different states?
    •	Which states have the highest and lowest booster dose coverage?
4.	Age-wise Vaccination Patterns
    •	How does vaccination coverage vary across different age groups (12-14 and 15-18 years)?
5.	State-wise Performance
    •	Which are the top-performing states in terms of vaccination coverage?
    •	Which states need policy interventions to improve coverage?
