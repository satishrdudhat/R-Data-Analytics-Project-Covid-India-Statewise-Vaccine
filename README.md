# R-Data-Analytics-Project-Covid-India-Statewise-Vaccine
I developed a comprehensive interactive dashboard in R-Studio using R and an Excel dataset to analyze state-wise COVID-19 vaccination trends. The project involved data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization, featuring dose comparisons, booster coverage, age-wise trends, and key insights using ggplot2, Plotly, and Flexdashboard.
